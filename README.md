# Graph-Based-WAN-and-LAN-Routing-Simulator
It models networks using an adjacency matrix and leverages classical algorithms to determine optimal routes under varying network conditions. The project supports both local networks (LAN) and wide-area networks (WAN), providing a comparative analysis of different routing strategies.
